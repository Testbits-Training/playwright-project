# playwright-project

This project is about to show some samples of web automation test project using Playwright. For those who are new to automation testing, this sample project also will help you ease while learning Playwright online at your own pace.

The tested web application is called Orange HRM, which can be visited at https://opensource-demo.orangehrmlive.com/. This app is a mock website that was created for automation testers to practice their skills on. The website is meant to mimic a Human Resources Management (HRM) application.

## Getting started

Installation
Playwright has its own test runner for end-to-end tests, we call it Playwright Test.

Using the VS Code extension
Install the VS Code extension from the marketplace.

If you don't have the Playwright Test npm package installed in your project, or if you are starting with a new testing project, "Install Playwright" action will help you get started.

* To install Playwright
Pick the browsers you'd like to use by default, don't worry, you'll be able to change them later to add or configure the browsers used.

Choose browsers
The extension automatically detects if you have [Playwright Test] installed and loads the [Playwright Test] projects into Visual Studio Code. By default it will select the first project as a run profile and inside the test explorer you can change this behavior to run a single test in multiple or different browsers.

* To install xlsx module : `npm install xlsx`
